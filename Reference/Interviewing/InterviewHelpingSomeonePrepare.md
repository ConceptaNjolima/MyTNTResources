# How to help someone prepare for an interview

## Understanding your Mentees readiness:
* Find out the data structures and algorithms your Mentee is familiar with. This will help you tailor what topics to focus on.
* Find out how many technical interviews your Mentee has already done.
* Share your interview experience with your Mentee, both successes and failures. This will make you relatable and allow them to open up.
* Ask them about their weak spots when it comes to interviewing. This will help both of you craft a plan to addressing those weak spots.
* Ask them about their areas of strength since this is a place where they can challenge themselves by attempting more challenging problems.

Explain the different types of interviews that they will experience:
* Coding
* Behavioral
* Product

Emphasize the need to have interview buddies and to do mock interviews.

Discuss the importance of coming up with an approach to solving problems versus doing a large number of questions. Learning the approach to solving problems will help them solve even those problems they have not yet seen.

Help them create an interview prep schedule. Having a schedule helps them get organized and makes the whole process less overwhelming. See Sample 6 week schedule

If you can, do a mock interview with them.


# The Approach

## Behavioral or situational questions
### How to answer
The key is direct, logical, and meaningful storytelling, answering with a specific examples. The interviewer is trying to learn about you and your response to situations that may come up in the work environment. STAR is one common framework for responding.
* S – Situation: describe the situation in which the task (what the question is asking about) occurred or was accomplished; the background from the work or school setting in which you'll describe how you addressed what the interviewer is asking. Set the scene.
* T-task: what you were working towards or the problem or challenge your faced. Describe the purpose.
* A-action: what you did, your role in the situation. Explain what you actions you took.
* R – results: the outcome, take credit for went what well. In situations where it didn't end well, describe the positive from what you learned and how it was applied. Share the outcome.

### Tips
Practice. Look at lists of common behavioral interview questions. 
* Think through scenarios that showcase your experience, leadership, teamwork, creativity, and grit.
* Practice giving a short description of each. 
* Be ready to describe the situation in more detail. Have a beginning, middle, and end to your storytelling that describes the situation, the problem or challenge, the action you took, and the result.
* Be honest and find examples that reflect positively on your actions.
* Look for examples across your experiences – school, work, clubs and activities.
* Be specific about an event or challenge.

## Code questions
### Understanding the question
Some tips on understanding the question are:
1. Repeating the question in your own words
2. Stating or writing out examples of the expected inputs and outputs
	
### Solving the problem without code. 
This involves:
1. Solving the problem using the brute force method - which  gives you a good starting point.
2. Solving a simpler version of the problem.
3. Thinking out loud about what types of algorithms you think would be best suited to solve the problem
4. Thinking out loud - stating some of the edge cases you solution may or may not solve.
5. Pausing to listen for hints from the interviewer.
6. Once you have an optimized solution to the problem, discussing the algorithmic complexity of your solution.
7. Writing an outline/pseudocode of your code. This will help you when you get to coding since you can reference your thinking. 

### Tips for finding Optimal solutions
* Think about the best possible runtime for the problem
* Think of space and time tradeoffs. How can you use Memory vs CPU to better solve the problem
* Think of alternative data structures
* Think of the bottlenecks to you current solution
* Think of the duplicate or unnecessary work in your current solution

### Writing good code
1. Use classes and methods
2. Make your methods have one responsibility, this will ensure they are small.
3. Use descriptive names for your variables and methods.
4. Start with the core part of the algorithm assuming you have methods that can handle different details. Then write those other detailed methods later on.
	
### Test your code
1. Run your code through  several examples, make sure to use some edge cases. It is ok if you find bugs, just note them and, if you have time fix, them.


## Product questions


# Sample 6 week schedule

## Week 1
1. List algorithms and data structures that you are familiar with.
2. List CS classes that you have taken.
3. List the coding language you are comfortable with. Stick to it during the whole interview process.
4. Read part VII of Cracking the Coding Interview(CTCI). It focuses on the process of tackling a coding question. That is what we need to master, not coding questions themselves.
5. Read part VI "Big O" of Cracking the Coding Interview.
6. Find an interview buddy that you can do mock interview questions with.

## Week 2
1. Read chapter 1 of CTCI and also review ArrayLists\Vectors and Hash Tables. 
2. With your interview buddy, attempt some of the questions (2-4) from one of the interview prep resources that are focused on Arrays, String, Hash Tables and Lists. 
3. Get familiar with a tool like https://coderpad.io/, just make sure to set the language to "Text". This will help you master your coding in your preferred language.
4. Try answering the following:
	a. Did you restate the coding questions you were asked in your own words?
	b. Did you ask clarifying questions?

## Week 3
1. Read chapters 2 and 8 of CTCI. The key concepts to understand are:
	a. Traversing a Linked List
	b. The runner's technique
	c. Recursion. The bottom up approach, which is covered in chapter 8. Just focus on simple recursion.
2. With your interview buddy, attempt some questions (2-4) focused on recursion and linked lists. 
3. Try answering the following:
	a. Did you try to follow the process in tackling the problems?
	b. How can you identify if a question would need recursion or a linked list?
	c. What is the time complexity of iterating a linked list via recursion?
	d. Have you encountered use of recursion or linked lists in your project work?
	e. What kind of names did you pick for your variables in your code?
		
## Week 4
1. Read Chapter 3 of CTCI. The main focus is on stacks and queues. We also want to focus on the process of solving the question.
2. Practice questions focused on stacks and queues. Make sure you are using plain text when you use tools like coderpad.io
3. Try answering the following:
	a. Are you speaking out loud while you solve the problem? (This is feedback you should get from your interview buddy.)
	b. Are you able to state the brute force solution to a problem before you get an optimal solution?
	c. Are you able to state why your optimal solution is better?
	d. Did you use the BUD process that was discussed in part VII of CTCI?
	e. Can someone read your code and be able to state what it is doing in less than a minute?

## Week 5
1. Read Chapter 4 of CTCI. The focus should be on Tree Traversal (pre-order, in-order and post-order) and Graph search using Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS). Note: if you have not had any classes in school on these topics you can instead focus on Chapter 5.
2. With your interview buddy, practice coding questions based on the chapters you studied.
3. Try answering the following:
	a. How can you identify whether a question is related to trees, graphs or Bit manipulation?
	b. Are you memorizing solutions to problems or focusing on the approach to solving the problems?
	c. What are your areas of weakness?
	d. Did you test your code when you were done?
4. See if you can schedule a mock interview with your mentor.

## Week 6
1. Read Chapter 10 of CTCI. Try to understand how Merge Sort, Quick Sort and Binary Search work. They build upon concepts you have covered in previous topics.
2. With your interview buddy, attempt some problems. 
3. Try answering the following:
	a. How can you identify if a question is related to sorting or searching?
	b. Are you comfortable with deriving the time and space complexity (Big O) of merge and quick sort?
	c. How clean is the code you are writing? Are you able to write up your code in notepad?
	d. Is your code modular; does it have small methods/functions? Is it easy to understand?
	e. Before you started coding did you walk through your approach to solving the problem?
	f. Did you test your code when you were done?
	4. At the end of the week, do a 1 hour mock interview with your mentor.
		

## Things to remember:
1. Focus on quality not quantity. This means, do not try to solve as many problems as possible. Rather try to master the process of solving problems - it will serve you well when dealing with all sorts of problems.
2. Focus on what you know. Don't get stuck worrying about topics you have not learned yet, most interviewers will ask you a question based on a topic you have already covered in school. Master the stuff you know.
