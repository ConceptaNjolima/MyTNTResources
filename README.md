# Introduction
Welcome to the TNT curriculum. The course introduces web app development with TypeScript and React using Visual Studio Code, Git, and GitHub combined with a design sprint, product thinking, and project mangement. New Technologists use these skills to build incredible prototype applications. The course is infused with experience of TNT mentors and coaches, connecting what's learned back to industry product development.

## How to use these materials
* **Instructors** - this course is the day by day lesson plan.
* **Coaches** - this is a map to connect with where teams are at through the program.
* **New Technologists** - this material is provided for your reference to review and expand your learning.

## Overview
The curriculum is divided into five threads that span five weeks.

* **Product thinking** - going from a problem statement to an impactful experience and pitch.
* **Project management** - executing and delivering as an engineering team.
* **Git and GitHub** - using version control and managing a project with a team.
* **Web design** - building a web application with HTML, CSS, and React.
* **Typescript programming** - building a web application with VS Code and TypeScript.

The course is applied to the to the application development process, end to end, from identifying user needs to building a prototype. The course acculumulates with NTs
