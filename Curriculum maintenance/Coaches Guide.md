# Coaches guide

This resources is aimed at coaches to follow the curriculum, guide prototype development, and infuse the curriculum with real-world product and development experiences. It's a guide, adapt to your team and where they're at.

## Week 0

NTs are onboarding.

## Week 1

This week introduces the basic technologies and tools the prototypes will be built with. NTs begin building with TypeScript and React in VS Code. NTs are also introduced to Git and the basic Git flow. The week ends with NTs building a basic list app.

NT groups are given a broad problem statement. NTs are introduced to the product development lifecycle and work in teams to break down the problem statement into concrete and addressable user needs. This week includes activities to empathize with user, define user needs, ideate and sketch.

### Day 1

#### tl;dr

* Kick off with your team and get to know one another!
* Check in on getting started with the engineering tools and tech - VS Code, TS, React
* Revisit the Intro to [Intro to PM and Design thinking](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/master/Reference/Product%20decks/1.0%20-%20Intro%20to%20pm%20and%20design%20thinking.pdf) content with your team especially - the PM role design thinking phases, MVP, and agile development.
* Make sure your team has a channel setup, encouraging having conversations in this channel and keeping all files there

#### Details

Kick off with your team and the product lifecycle! Two main objectives - start to get to know everyone and review the [Intro to PM and Design thinking](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/master/Reference/Product%20decks/1.0%20-%20Intro%20to%20pm%20and%20design%20thinking.pdf). Start with introductions, names and pronouns. Consider an ice breaker like:

* If you could have lunch with anyone, who what it be?
* What was your favorite course?
* Where do you most want to travel to?

Share about yourself, what you work on and what you do outside of work. As the NTs the same.

Kick of a discussion on how getting started is going, ask NTs about:

* VS Code and TypeScript, where they able to get started and up and running?
* Things going ok with Teams and Outlook, any questions?

Review the Intro to PM and Design thinking deck with your team. NTs should have read through this prior to meeting. Key touch points:

* PM role - discuss your work as a PM and the range of the PM roles and responsibilities. It's a unique opportunity with the program for the NTs to experience both PM and engineering.
* Design thinking - talk about the schedule and progressing through these phases over the next two weeks. Help the NTs map this to the prototype they're building as an output. At this point it's critical to step away from the details of implementation and get ready to empathize with users and think boldly and broadly.
* MVP - revisit the concept of an MVP. The NTs will shape their MVP for their prototype with their spec.
* Agile development - give an example of how your team or product uses agile engineering. Talk through your experiences with a sprint. Talk through a time or project you used waterfall method with. Reinforce that the program will bring in aspects of agile development.

Time permitting, lead your team through an exercise of designing a product. Start with a broad problem statement like "design a ticket machine" or "design a refrigerator". Make sure they keep the customer at the center, walk through who it's for and some common needs or problems it must address.

Check that your team has created a channel under their group. Encourage them to have discussions here rather than a private chat so you can stay connected. Reinforce keeping files there as well.

### Day 2

#### tl;dr

* Groups get their problem statements! Check in on how they feel - excited? disappointed? nervous?
* [Empathize with users](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/master/Reference/Product%20decks/1.1%20-%20Empathize%20with%20users.pdf) introduces the role of UX researcher and empathy mapping. Reiterate that this phase is about learning what the users need and their problems, rather than jumping to a solution.
* Check in on how they are doing with the activities - just getting started, well underway? Any questions? Give an example of how user research has impacted your product or works.
* NTs started on Git learning with the introduction to Git and the local workflow. Share about your experience learning Git.

#### Details

Each group received their problem statement today. It was posted in the General channel for the group in the morning. Your team may be at various phases of digesting the problem statement. Check-in with your team and get their read on whether or not they're excited. This is a chance to encourage a resilient and growth mindset if they were hoping for a different one.

This kicks of the empathize design phase! The goal is to develop a deep, empathetic understanding of the user needs by observing, engaging and immersing. Reiterate that at this point it's not about finding the solution but figure out what you're going to solve for. NTs have started are started activities to uncover these needs and build an empathy maps.

* Check-in on how it's going, how they divided the work, and encourage the use of OneNote if it's not already there.
* If well underway, have the NTs talk through the empathy map and share the key pain points they've found.
* Be on the look out for talk of the app they're going to build or particular features. Bring the discussion back to what they're learning about the user.

NTs engineering focus today is on Git. Check-in on questions, share your experience with source control, Git, and re-encourage that it's a learned skill that takes practice.

### Day 3

#### tl;dr

* It's been a busy week, consider a one word check-in or some way to share how it's going.
* Teams should have wrapped up with empathize investigation activities and moved onto the [define phase](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/master/Reference/Product%20decks/1.2%20-%20Define%20needs.pdf). Check-in on where they're at in this process and ask to see the latest work.
* Push to keep the discussion solution agnostic and rooted in user needs if you see it drifting towards a particular application.
* Today the NTs are also introduced to the create React app tool. Ask for demo or dive into a discussion on the basics of web architecture.

#### Details

It has been a big week with many introductions, new tools, and getting in a rhythm working as a team. Ask everyone how they're doing in or feeling at this moment with one word. Share too and connections to feelings with getting started and something new. Look for positive and negative trends to pull more info out on.

NTs have begun the [define](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/master/Reference/Product%20decks/1.2%20-%20Define%20needs.pdf) phase and are refining towards an addressable problem statement. They're identifying their specific target audience and creating user journey maps. See where the are in the process and if they have an questions:

* At this point the discussions should be solution agnostic, not talking about specific applications or features.
* Check-in and make sure all NTs are participating in the activities. Even if it's not their favorite part of the program it's important to take the time in these phases to make sure you build something great. Everyone has something to contribute that expands thinking here.
* Depending on the timing, NTs may have come up with problem statements and created an affinity diagram. Ask for a tour. Look for trends they may haven't seen or help them expand if the problem statements are too narrow.

On the engineering side of the focus is getting started with create React app.

* Prompt a discussion around the architecture of a web app.
* Ask for demo.
* Ask the team to explain how all the pieces they've learned so far work together. Fill in any unknowns as a group.

### Day 4

#### tl;dr

* Set the tone for open brainstorming with great ideas pitch or an activity to build support of ideas in brainstorming.
* Today the NTs enter the [ideation phase](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/master/Reference/Product%20decks/1.3%20-%20HMW%20and%20ideation.pdf), using a how might we exercise to come up with two potential problem statements as a team. Check-in on where they're at in the process. Ensure that all perspectives are represented.
* NTs started with the list app work, the first project. Ask for a volunteer to share where they're at open the floor to questions on the work.

#### Details

Consider kicking off today with an activity that focuses on big ideas and building off one another. Set the tone for how you can work together on product ideas. Great idea pitch is an exercise where everyone takes turns pitching from a list of not so great ideas. Introduce this activity through a how might we statement, and give an example of bad idea. For example, for 2 minutes let's create a list of the worst possible way to - "make fast food restaurants faster" Examples:

* "Don't let cars stop..."
* "Leave food partially cooked so people can cook it at home"
...

Next the ideas are pitched. Everyone gets a minute. Randomly choose an idea from the list. Pitch why it is the best idea ever. Build off of one another. There are no bad ideas here... only ideas that need a creative pitch. Start if no one volunteers.

The NTs have begun the ideation phase, beginning to come up with solutions and further refine the exact problem statement they're going to tackle with their prototypes. Encourage broad thinking. Depending on team progress ask to see Crazy 8s or join in a round if they're in the middle. Ask to see their HMW affinity diagram.

On the engineering side, today NTs were introduced to the to-do sample app project. It brings together TS, React and the tools from this week. The focus is on the basic functionality over visuals.

* Poll for how everyone is feeling about the project. Ask for someone to walk through the project goal and what they're working on.
* Check-in on using the Git workflow locally, committing changes as they go. Next week the NTs will cover remote repositories and create a repo in GitHub.
* Ask for a demo or for someone to share where they're at.

## Day 5

6/3 Holiday - everyone has the day off

## Week 2

Early in the week NTs continue and wrap up working on their list app. In the Git learning track, NTs are introduced to remote repositories and team development practices using branches. Applying, NTs move their list app to GitHub and later in the week as a group practice working together on a sample app. Views, layouts, and UI debugging allow NTs to revisit the list app and update.

Working through the design phases, NTs  start the first iteration of the prototype and test. NTs create paper prototypes, begin early usability testing, and create first drafts of their value prop and pitch. Volunteer as a usability participant and listen to the pitch. The teams will still go through phases of expanding and refining app and feature ideas. When lost or debating, evaluate the solution to the problem statement against how well it meets the user needs.

### Day 1

#### tl;dr

* Reconnect after the long weekend.
* Teams are introduced to [Usability and interviewing](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/master/Reference/Product%20decks/2.0%20-%20Usability%20and%20interviewing.pdf) and begin creating their interview guide. Check in and volunteer to practice.
* Remote repositories are introduced. NTs move to-do apps to a remote repository and begin working there.

#### Details

NTs wrapped up last week with ideation. There may be mixed feelings heading into the second week excited or disappointed, fatigued or re-energized. Ask about the long weekend, share about your weekend and gauge where everyone is at.

Check-in and talk through the concept of remote repositories and strategies for Git back tracking. Docs on the computer vs docs in Google drive make a great analogy.

On the product side, NTs learned about user research and usability testing. Both coaches share about your user research experiences and being customer driven. Talk about how your features crews have worked with user researchers. NTs have begun writing their user research guide. The guide focus today is goals, what they want to learn, and interview questions. Tomorrow they'll work on paper prototypes and then define their usability tasks.

* Volunteer to be interviewed as a participant.
* Look for open-ended, non-leading questions.
* Complete the interview and then give feedback at the end.

Again, check that the usability guide is saved somewhere shared in Teams, either a Word doc or OneNote.
