# Coaches guide

This resources is aimed at coaches to follow the curriculum, guide prototype development, and infuse the curriculum with real-world product and development experiences.

## Week 0

NTs are onboarding.

## Week 1

This week introduces the basic technologies and tools the prototypes will be built with. NTs begin building with TypeScript and React in VS Code. NTs are also introduced to Git and the basic Git flow. The week ends with NTs building a basic list app.

NT groups are given a broad problem statement. NTs are introduced to the product development lifecycle and work in teams to break down the problem statement into concrete and addressable user needs. This week includes activities to empathize with user, define user needs, ideate and sketch.

### Day 1

#### tl;dr

* Kick off with your team and get to know one another!
* Check in on getting started with the engineering tools and tech - VS Code, TS, React
* Check in on the problem statement - Excited? Disappointed? Nervous?
* Revisit the Intro to PM and Design thinking
* Make sure your team has a channel setup, encouraging having conversations in this channel and keeping all files there

#### Details

Kick off with your team and the product lifecycle! Two main objectives - start to get to know everyone and review the [Intro to PM and Design thinking](Reference\Product decks\1.0 - Intro to pm and design thinking_5_11.pdf). Start with introductions, names and pronouns. Consider an ice breaker like:

* If you could have lunch with anyone, who what it be?
* What was your favorite course?
* Where do you most want to travel to?

Share about yourself, what you work on and what you do outside of work. As the NTs the same.

Kick of a discussion on how getting started is going, ask NTs about:

* VS Code and TypeScript, where they able to get started and up and running?
* What's the problem statement for the group? Are they excited or where they hoping for a different one? What are there initial thoughts?

Review the Intro to PM and Design thinking deck with your team. NTs should have read through this prior to meeting. Key touch points:

* PM role - discuss your work as a PM and the range of the PM roles and responsibilities. It's a unique opportunity with the program for the NTs to experience both PM and engineering.
* Design thinking - talk about the schedule and progressing through these phases over the next two weeks. Help the NTs map this to the prototype they're building as an output. At this point it's critical to step away from the details of implementation and get ready to empathize with users and think boldly and broadly.
* MVP - revisit the concept of an MVP. The NTs will shape their MVP for their prototype with their spec.
* Agile development - give an example of how your team or product uses agile engineering. Talk through your experiences with a sprint. Talk through a time or project you used waterfall method with. Reinforce that the program will bring in aspects of agile development.

Check that your team has created a channel under their group. Encourage them to have discussions here rather than a private chat so you can stay connected. Reinforce keeping files there as well.
