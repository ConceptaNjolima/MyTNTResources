# Coaches guide

This resources is aimed at coaches to follow the curriculum, guide prototype development, and infuse the curriculum with real-world product and development experiences.

## Week 0

NTs are onboarding.

## Week 1

This week introduces the basic technologies and tools the prototypes will be built with. NTs begin building with TypeScript and React in VS Code. NTs are also introduced to Git and the basic Git flow. The week ends with NTs building a basic list app.

NT groups are given a broad problem statement. NTs are introduced to the product development lifecycle and work in teams to break down the problem statement into concrete and addressable user needs. This week includes activities to empathize with user, define user needs, ideate and sketch.

### Day 1

#### tl;dr

* Kick off with your team and get to know one another!
* Check in on getting started with the engineering tools and tech - VS Code, TS, React
* Revisit the Intro to [Intro to PM and Design thinking](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/master/Reference/Product%20decks/1.0%20-%20Intro%20to%20pm%20and%20design%20thinking.pdf) content with your team especially - the PM role design thinking phases, MVP, and agile development.
* Make sure your team has a channel setup, encouraging having conversations in this channel and keeping all files there

#### Details

Kick off with your team and the product lifecycle! Two main objectives - start to get to know everyone and review the [Intro to PM and Design thinking](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/master/Reference/Product%20decks/1.0%20-%20Intro%20to%20pm%20and%20design%20thinking.pdf). Start with introductions, names and pronouns. Consider an ice breaker like:

* If you could have lunch with anyone, who what it be?
* What was your favorite course?
* Where do you most want to travel to?

Share about yourself, what you work on and what you do outside of work. As the NTs the same.

Kick of a discussion on how getting started is going, ask NTs about:

* VS Code and TypeScript, where they able to get started and up and running?
* Things going ok with Teams and Outlook, any questions?

Review the Intro to PM and Design thinking deck with your team. NTs should have read through this prior to meeting. Key touch points:

* PM role - discuss your work as a PM and the range of the PM roles and responsibilities. It's a unique opportunity with the program for the NTs to experience both PM and engineering.
* Design thinking - talk about the schedule and progressing through these phases over the next two weeks. Help the NTs map this to the prototype they're building as an output. At this point it's critical to step away from the details of implementation and get ready to empathize with users and think boldly and broadly.
* MVP - revisit the concept of an MVP. The NTs will shape their MVP for their prototype with their spec.
* Agile development - give an example of how your team or product uses agile engineering. Talk through your experiences with a sprint. Talk through a time or project you used waterfall method with. Reinforce that the program will bring in aspects of agile development.

Time permitting, lead your team through an exercise of designing a product. Start with a broad problem statement like "design a ticket machine" or "design a refrigerator". Make sure they keep the customer at the center, walk through who it's for and some common needs or problems it must address.

Check that your team has created a channel under their group. Encourage them to have discussions here rather than a private chat so you can stay connected. Reinforce keeping files there as well.

### Day 2

#### tl;dr

* Groups get their problem statements! Check in on how they feel - excited? disappointed? nervous?
* [Empathize with users](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/master/Reference/Product%20decks/1.1%20-%20Empathize%20with%20users.pdf) introduces the role of UX researcher and empathy mapping. Reiterate that this phase is about learning what the users need and their problems, rather than jumping to a solution.
* Check in on how they are doing with the activities - just getting started, well underway? Any questions? Give an example of how user research has impacted your product or works.
* NTs started on Git learning with the introduction to Git and the local workflow. Share about your experience learning Git.

#### Details

Each group received their problem statement today. It was posted in the General channel for the group in the morning. Your team may be at various phases of digesting the problem statement. Check-in with your team and get their read on whether or not they're excited. This is a chance to encourage a resilient and growth mindset if they were hoping for a different one.

This kicks of the empathize design phase! The goal is to develop a deep, empathetic understanding of the user needs by observing, engaging and immersing. Reiterate that at this point it's not about finding the solution but figure out what you're going to solve for. NTs have started are started activities to uncover these needs and build an empathy maps.

* Check-in on how it's going, how they divided the work, and encourage the use of OneNote if it's not already there.
* If well underway, have the NTs talk through the empathy map and share the key pain points they've found.
* Be on the look out for talk of the app they're going to build or particular features. Bring the discussion back to what they're learning about the user.

NTs engineering focus today is on Git. Check-in on questions, share your experience with source control, Git, and re-encourage that it's a learned skill that takes practice.
