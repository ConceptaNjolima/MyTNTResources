# Coaches guide

This resources is aimed at coaches to follow the curriculum, guide prototype development, and infuse the curriculum with real-world product and development experiences.

## Week 0

NTs are onboarding.

## Week 1

This week introduces the basic technologies and tools the prototypes will be built with. NTs begin building with TypeScript and React in VS Code. NTs are also introduced to Git and the basic Git flow. The week ends with NTs building a basic list app.

NT groups are given a broad problem statement. NTs are introduced to the product development lifecycle and work in teams to break down the problem statement into concrete and addressable user needs. This week includes activities to empathize with user, define user needs, ideate and sketch.

### Day 1

Kick off with your team and the product lifecycle! Two main objectives - start to get to know everyone and review the [Intro to PM and Design thinking](Reference\Product decks\1.0 - Intro to pm and design thinking_5_11.pdf). Start with introductions, names and pronouns. Consider an ice breaker like:

* If you could have lunch with anyone, who what it be?
* What was your favorite course?
* Where do you most want to travel to?

Share about yourself, what you work on and what you do outside of work. As the NTs the same.

Kick of a discussion on how getting started is going, ask NTs about:

* VS Code and TypeScript, where they able to get started and up and running?
* What's the problem statement for the group? Are they excited or where they hoping for a different one? What are there initial thoughts?

Review the Intro to PM and Design thinking deck with your team.

Before you end,  check that your team has created a channel under their group. Encourage them to have discussions here rather than a private chat so you can stay connected. Reinforce keeping files there as well.
