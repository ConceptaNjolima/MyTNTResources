# Team Project Practice
With this project NTs review a spec and break down the engineering work. The teams then merge intial changes for the project into the same repo and resolve and resolve any merge issues. The goal is not to complete the app as spec'd rather gain experience breaking down the work and coding together.

## Learning objectives
TNTs will understand how to break down work.
TNTs will understand how to scope work.
TNTs will practice merging and resolving merge conflicts.

## Time required and pace
Total time: 5hrs hour, 45 instruction, remaining work time
* 10 minutes - engage: revist best practices for resolving merge conflicts
* 20 minutes - explain: introduce the spec and how to break down work
* 3 hours - explore: during work time teams break down the engineering work and review with coaches, create and check-in first changes, resolve merge issues
* 30 minutes - elaborate: review trouble spots
* 1 hour - evaluate: NTs finish initial changes and resolve merge issues
