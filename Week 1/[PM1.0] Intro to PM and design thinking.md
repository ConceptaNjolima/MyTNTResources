# Intro to PM and design thinking
This lesson introduces the roles of program (product) manager (PM) and gives an overview of how products are designed. 

## Learning objectives
* TNTs will understand the role of PM in in the engineering lifecycle.
* TNTs will learn design thinking methodolgy.
* TNTs will be able to view the upcomming problem statement through the design thinking lens. 

## Time required and pace
Total time: 50 min
* 10 minutes - engage: lunch with anyone
* 25 minutes - explain: PM, product lifecycle
* 15 minutes - explore: design a refrigerator

## Background / review
This lesson will be led by PM coach(es) from the building.
* Deck: 
* Prepare exampls from own product experience: working across the product lifecycle (Framing, Defining, Delivering) working across disciplines

## Lesson details
### Engage: lunch with anyone (10 minutes)
1. If you could meet any historical figure and have lunch, who would it be?
2. Go around the room, sharing: names, preferred pronouns, and the historical figure.

### Explain: Introduction to PM and the product lifecycle (25 minutes)
1. High-level program sequence: introduction week was week 0, the previous week. This week kicks design thinking and the design sprint, in addition to core engineering concepts.
2. As the app plan lands, more time will transition to building until the final pitch and presentation.
3. The role of prodcut manager or program manager (PM) is explained - why, when, and what of the product.
4. Review the design sprint and the product lifecycle.
5. Overview the common discipline roles for product development - PM, engineering, design, data, and research.

### Explore: Design a refridgerator
1. The problem statement for designing a refridgerator is introduced.
2. As a room the NTs design a refridgerator, applying design concepts just introduced.
