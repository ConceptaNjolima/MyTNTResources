# Intro to PM and design thinking

This lesson introduces the roles of program (product) manager (PM) and gives an overview of how products are designed.

## Learning objectives

* TNTs will understand the role of PM in in the engineering life cycle.
* TNTs will learn design thinking methodology.
* TNTs will be able to view the product problem statement through the design thinking lens

## Time required and pace

Total time: 60 min

* 10 minutes - engage: lunch with anyone
* 35 minutes - explain: PM, design thinking phases, MVP, product life cycle
* 15 minutes - explore: design a refrigerator

## Pre-session

None

## Background / review

* Deck: [Product decks](https://github.com/microsoft/TNT_Curriculum/tree/master/Reference/Product%20decks)
* Prepare examples from own product experience: working across the product life cycle (Framing, Defining, Delivering) working across disciplines

## Lesson details

### Engage: lunch with anyone (10 minutes)

1. If you could meet any historical figure and have lunch, who would it be?
2. Go around the room, sharing: names, preferred pronouns, and the historical figure.

### Explain: Introduction to PM and the product life cycle (25 minutes)

This lesson is backed by a deck.

1. High-level program sequence: introduction week was week 0, the previous week. This week kicks design thinking and the design sprint, in addition to core engineering concepts.
2. As the app plan lands, more time will transition to building until the final pitch and presentation.
3. The role of product manager or program manager (PM) is explained - why, when, and what of the product.
4. Review the design sprint and the product life cycle.
5. Overview the common discipline roles for product development - PM, engineering, design, data, and research.

### Explore: Design a refrigerator

1. The problem statement for designing a refrigerator is introduced.
2. As a room the NTs design a refrigerator, applying design concepts just introduced.
