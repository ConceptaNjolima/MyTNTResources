## Time required and pace
Total time: 1.5 hour
* 10 minutes - engage: opening activity
* 20 minutes - explain
* 30 minutes - explore: specific activity
* 15 minutes - elaborate: review trouble spots
* 15 minutes - evaluate: specific activity to demonstrate understanding

## Background / review

### EXPLAIN  TODO
There's likely a range of familiarity with web pages, web apps, and how they work. This refresher aims at closing any gaps and providing  the opportunity to dig in and get familiar with resources that will be useful throughout the program.

     * Website - 
     * Web app -

2. How do web apps compare to apps on iOS, Android, or Windows?
     * 

3. How HTML, CSS, and JavaScript come together:
     * W3Schools describe it well:
         * Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) - the language for building webpages
         * Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) - the language for styling webpages
         * JavaSCript - the language for programming web pages
    * Draw or display diagram of the languages working together

4. Demo w3schools.com
     * References - summarize what the languages do
     * Tutorials - learning paths
     * Examples - sample code for more complex properties, features, and functions
