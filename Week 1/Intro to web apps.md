This lesson provides an overview of how web apps work, HTML and CSS to lay the foundation for the prototypes NTs will build.

*Open questions in lesson*
* *create app architecure diagram*
* *is it worth spending time on HTML and CSS basics - is more instruction needed or exploration level ok*?
* *stretch goals for lesson?*

## Learning objectives

## Lesson details
### Tradeoffs of web apps and native apps (20 minutes)
1. What is a website and a web app?
      * Website - informational, can be static or dynamic
      * Web app - interactive, user control, saves data, often sign-in (identity)

2. How do web apps compare to apps on iOS, Android, or Windows?
      * Apps targeting a a specific operating system are called "native apps" and work just on that platform - iOS, Android, Windows, Linux
      * Some examples of how they compare:
      
        | Native Apps  | Web apps |
        |---|---|
        | Specific operating system   | Internet browser  |
        | Install from app store, download | URL, access online |
        | Performance optimized for platform | Performance optimized for browser |

3.  As a group:
       * List examples of websites, web applications, and native applications
       * Research and list how web applications are both similar and different than native applications, consider a venn diagram
       * Answer: why would you build a web app vs. native app? What are the tradeoffs of each?

4.  Come back together:
       * Groups share top similarities and differences
       * Groups share tradeoffs

### Intro to tech and web app architecture (15 minutes)
There's likely a range of familiarity with web pages, web apps, and how they work. This refresher aims at closing any gaps and providing  the opportunity to dig in and get familiar with resources that will be applicable throughout the program.

1.  Why are we building a web app?
       * Quick to prototype
       * Introduction to broadly applicable tech - VS Code, HTML, CSS, TypeScript
       * Many projects - professional, community, philanthropic, for fun... have some web component
       * Some capabilities between web and native apps are closing

2. Tech we will use and introduce over the next week. This lesson focuses on HTML, CSS, and an introduction to TypeScript.

      | Technology / Tooling | Solution |
      |---|---|
      | Programming Language   | HTML, CSS, TypeScript  |
      | Web framework | React |
      | Component library | Fabric |
      | Store management | Redux and state component|
      | Sever environment | Node.js, npm|
      | Package manager | Yarn |
      | Source control | Git |
      | Source control tools | SourceTree, Command line, VS Code|
      | Testing infrastructure | Jest |
      | Debugging | VS Code debugger |
      | Text editor | VS Code |
      | Project setup | React create app tool |

3.  How HTML, CSS, and TypeScript come together. W3Schools describes it well:
       * Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) - the language for building webpages
       * Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) - the language for styling webpages
       * TypeScript (JS) - the language for programming web pages

4. TypeScript vs. JavaScript
      * TypeScript (TS) is a super set of JavaScript (JS), JS + additional features and capabilities
      * TS is strongly typed - only certain values can be assigned to certain data types
      * JS is weakly typed - makes conversations between data types, automatically types for you
      * TS is object oriented - built on logical, reusable objects
      * TS is compiled - it generates JS
      * Major benefits: easier to debug, easier to build programs that scale

5. Introduce app architecture diagram
     *BasicArchitecture.png
 
6. Demo w3schools.com
     * References - summarizes what the languages do
     * Tutorials - learning paths
     * Examples - sample code for more complex properties, features, and functions
     * Good reference and learning resource

### W3School HTML and CSS activities (30 minutes)
1. Start here:
     * [HTML basics](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp)
     * [CSS intro](w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp)
2. If you are familiar with HTML and CSS - find a new topic tutorials and try it out. Push yourself to discover something you didn't know before.
3. If you are new to HTML and CSS continue with the tutorials in order, they do a pretty good job building on one another.

### What did you learn? (10 minutes)
1. In your building's Team channel, post what you learned - a new tag, syntax, or property? The mystery behind to why [MySpace](https://news.codecademy.com/myspace-coding-legacy/) (insert your favorite classic early internet customizable site here) was so popular?
2. As group, poll for anything that's stumped or blocking.

### Mock up sample app (15 minutes)
1. Pick one of your favorite apps on your phone.
2. Using the [online editor](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_default) try to mock, or recreate, a single screen from the app with CSS and HTML.
3. Post your screen in your team's Team channel.
4. If you finish one screen, choose another more challenging screen.
