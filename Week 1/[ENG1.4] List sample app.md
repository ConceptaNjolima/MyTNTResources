# Sample app - bringing it TS, React, HTML, and CSS together
In this lesson NTs will build a sample mobile list app that demonstrates how the core technologies work together. In future lessons the same sample app will be used for more advanced topics.

## Learning objectives
* TNTs will understand how the intro blocks of TS, React, HTML, and CSS are used in the app.
* TNTs will learn how to add a React component and TS logic, manage app props, add input that affects the app.

## Time required and pace
Total time: 2 hrs hour
* 10 minutes - engage: 
* 20 minutes - explain: introduce project spec, component, props, input
* 30 minutes - explore: build list app
* 15 minutes - elaborate: check-in on progress
* 45 minutes - evaluate: continue list app and push to GitHub
