# Sample app - bringing it TS, React, HTML, and CSS together

In this lesson NTs will build a sample mobile list app that demonstrates how the core technologies work together. In future lessons the same sample app will be used for more advanced topics.

## Learning objectives

* TNTs will understand how the intro blocks of TS, React, HTML, and CSS are used in the app.
* TNTs will learn how to add a React component and TS logic, manage app props, add input that affects the app.

## Time required and pace

Total time: 2 hrs hour

* 10 minutes - engage: 
* 20 minutes - explain: introduce project spec, component, props, input
* 30 minutes - explore: build list app
* 15 minutes - elaborate: check-in on progress
* 45 minutes - evaluate: continue list app

## Background / review

## Lesson details

### engage (10 minutes)

### Introduce project spec, components, props, inputs (20 minutes)

We're going to build a list app. These is a high level introduction of the steps and app requirements.

1. Initialize the the app and get the new app up and running with the create react app default.
2. Change the contents of the app and create a new component.

Here are examples that will guide app creation:
2. Component example
3. Prop example
4. Input example
5. Revisit git best practices

### Build list app (30 minutes)

NTs kick off building the list app

### Check-in on progress

Regroup as team, what's going well, what are you blocked on

### Continue list app and push to GitHub (45 minutes)

1. Try completing functionality
2. Commit and Push to GitHub as you go
3. End of lesson, final Push and comment on what you learned and what was challenging

### Steps
