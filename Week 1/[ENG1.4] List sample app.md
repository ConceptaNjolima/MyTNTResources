# Sample app - bringing it TS, React, HTML, and CSS together

In this lesson NTs will build a sample mobile list app that demonstrates how the core technologies work together. In future lessons the same sample app will be used for more advanced topics.

## Learning objectives

* TNTs will understand how the intro blocks of TS, React, HTML, and CSS are used in the app.
* TNTs will learn how to add a React component and TS logic, manage app props, add input that affects the app.

## Time required and pace

Total time: 2 hrs hour

* 10 minutes - engage: common controls
* 20 minutes - explain: introduce project spec, component, props, input
* 30 minutes - explore: build list app
* 15 minutes - elaborate: check-in on progress
* 45 minutes - evaluate: continue list app

## Background / review

* [Create React app] (https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/)

## Lesson details

### Common controls (10 minutes)

Controls in a user interface (UI) follow familiar patterns of behavior. Customers using an app expect that certain controls behave in a certain way. For example - a checkbox allows you to select more than one option while a radio button only allows you to select one option. These affordances, when the quality or property of an object defines its possible uses or makes it clear how it can or should be used, increases ease of use. Many of these controls are provided by the platform or operating system as part of the developer experience.  

* NTs - Look at two apps on your phone or computer. What common controls or interaction patterns do you see?
* Post one common control to the Teams channel.
* Come back together as a group.Share highlights. Some places to look if they're missed - navigation, window management, backstage and menus, buttons - radio, checkbox, dropdown, date / time picker...
* Keep these common behaviors and interaction patterns in mind as you think about your prototypes.

### Introduce project spec, components, props, inputs (20 minutes)

We're going to build a list app. These is a high level introduction of the steps and app requirements.

1. Initialize the the app and get the new app up and running with the create react app default.
2. Change the contents of the app and create a new component.
3. The first piece added is a shopping item.
4. Then the ability to create many ShoppingItems in App followed by creating ShoppingItems iteratively from an object.
5. Move shopping items to state.
6. Create delete ShoppingItem function
7. Create addShoppingItem function and input text
8. Stretch goals are styling, checking for empty inputs, duplicate inputs, and adding more props like quantities

Here are examples of components, props, and inputs that are essential to building the to-do app.

1. Component example
2. Prop example
3. Input example

### Build list app (30 minutes)

NTs kick off building the list app

### Check-in on progress

Regroup as team, what's going well, what are you blocked on

### Continue list app and push to GitHub (45 minutes)

1. Try completing functionality
2. Commit and Push to GitHub as you go
3. End of lesson, final Push and comment on what you learned and what was challenging

### Steps

[list app steps]([ENGresource]ListAppSteps.md)

## Stretch

* Check for input, duplicates, more props (quantities)
* Stylize the app
