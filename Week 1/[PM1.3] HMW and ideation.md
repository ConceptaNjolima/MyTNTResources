# How Might We and Ideation

This session continues in the define phase of the design thinking phases and move into ideate. NTs expand thinking on their problem statement.

## Learning objectives

* TNTs will understand how to use the how might we framework to expand thinking.
* TNTs will learn strategies for drawing ideas.
* TNTs will practices pitching early ideas.

## Time required and pace

Total time: 1 hour 50 minutes

* 10 minutes - engage: great idea pitch :D
* 20 minutes - explain: introduce the how might we exercise and crazy 8s
* 30 minutes - explore: brainstorm with HMW
* 20 minutes - elaborate: kick off crazy 8s
* 30 minutes - explore: two rounds of crazy 8s and sharing

## Pre-session

Get paper and a marker ready

## Lesson details

### Introduce how might we and crazy 8s (20 min)

The deck walks through two exercises that help further define the problem statement and then expand ideas on how the problem statement might be addressed.

## Great idea pitch (10 min)

Introduce this activity and give an example of bad idea and then later give an example of a pitch.

2 minutes - As a team start a shared list of the worst possible way to - "make fast food restaurants faster"

* "Don't let cars stop..."
* "Leave food partially cooked so people can cook it at home"
...

1 minute each person - Randomly choose an idea from the list. Pitch why it is the best idea ever. Bulid off of one another. There are no bad ideas here... only ideas that need a creative pitch.

Bring the openness to the ideation today.

### Brainstorm with HMW (30 min)

1. Revisit the problem statement affinity diagram from yesterday.
2. As a group, choose the top two places to explore further. Make sure all voices are heard.
3. Expand on those problem statements with HMW. Start a new shared white board. Write the two problem statement themes to work from.
    * For 5 minutes, individually, come up with as many HMW statements related to the problem statements.
    * Put one on each sticky note.
4. Regroup. Take turns sharing each note you wrote.
    * Group like items together to create a new infinity diagram.
5. Pick two themes. Build two concise problem statements from the groups you've created.
    * The problem statements should be meaningful, actionable, and human-centric.

### Kick off crazy 8s (5 min)

* Every one check back in together as a larger group. Each team share their two problem statements.
* Next we're moving on to crazy 8s. You're responsible for keeping your own time. Focus on high-level solutions and move beyond just an app or technology. Anything is possible. There is no limit.

### Two rounds of crazy 8s and sharing (30 min)

2 x Crazy 8s

1. Fold a paper into eight sections and pick one of the problem statements start with.
2. Start a timer for 5 minutes. Draw something in each section.
3. Regroup as a team and share each section.
4. Repeat (with the other problem statement)!

Wrap up:

* Take a picture of each of your crazy 8s. Add it to the folder in your Team's channel.
* You can repeat this as needed to keep ideating.
