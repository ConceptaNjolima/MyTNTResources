# Problem statement and user needs

During this session each building receives their broad problem statement. The concepts of user needs is reenforced and students explore the problem space to develop customer empathy.

## Learning objectives

* TNTs will learn about their problem statement.
* TNTs will conduct investigations to begin collocating information and data that will inform user needs.
* TNTs will practice skills for productive product discussions.

## Time required and pace

Total time: 1.5 hour

* 10 minutes - engage: practice listening
* 20 minutes - explain: introduce problem statement, revisit user needs, introduce methods for exploration
* 30 minutes - explore: kick off team exploration around problem statement
* 10 minutes - elaborate: check-in
* 50 minutes - evaluate: continue and summarize research in teams channel

## Lesson details

### Practice listening (10 minutes)

Listening is a skill. Active listening and open ended question asking can uncover user pain points and needs. Today we'll practice with the magic word "tell me more about that".

1. Pair up or groups of three in your team.
2. The storyteller picks a location they'd like to visit or travel too and begins describing the location with vague details.
3. The listener(s) can only ask:
    * Tell me more about [x].
    * Tell me more about the weather...
    * Tell me more about the food...
    * Tell me more about transportation options...
4. The listener announces when they figured out where the storyteller wants to go.
5. Switch roles and try again.

### Introduce problem statement (5 min)

The problem statements are derived from the NTs Week 0 investigations. Themes are shared from their focus groups and rooms vote / stack rank the themes.

*This will be updated after the problem statements are announced for each building*

The themes for 2020 by building are:

* 1:
* 2:
* 3:
* 4:

### Explain (15 min)

Details are in the deck. The deck:

* Revisit design thinking phases
* Dive into empathize phase
* Introduce methods for exploration and start

### Explore (30 min)

NTs work in their teams to kick off the empathize phase.

1. Spend a few minutes digesting the problem statement together. Share - are you excited? Hoping for something else?Questions on what it means or clarification?
2. Dive into the strategies shared in the explain section. Split them up and work individually or in pairs for the interview exercise.
    * Take notes in OneNote as you go.
3. Reach out on Teams if you're blocked or have a question.

### Check-in (10 min)

* Regroup as a building.
* Any questions? What has worked well? Where are you blocked?

### Continue and combine (50 minutes)

* Keep on with the investigations, consider switching methods within your team
* Leave 15-20 to summarize your findings. Create an empathy map and post three major pain points you've identified in the building Team channel.
  * Regroup as a team
  * Walk through your findings together, build on one another and expand, don't shut anything down
  * Pull your research together into an empathy map
  * Look for common trends in pain points
* Share with your coaches
