# Define needs

This session enters the define phase of design thinking. It's the first step of refining and articulating the problem statements NTs will address.

## Learning objectives

* TNTs will revisit the phases of design thinking.
* TNTs will practice methods for articulating their target audience.
* TNTs will map the user journey.
* TNTs will learn what makes a great problem statement.

## Time required and pace

Total time: 2 hour

* 10 minutes - engage: pass draw
* 30 minutes - explain: target audience, user journey mapping
* 30 minutes - explore: user journey mapping
* 15 minutes - elaborate: regroup and share with team
* 35 minutes - evaluate: write problem statements

## Pre-session

Get paper and a marker ready

## Background / review

Deck:

## Lesson details

This lesson will be led by PM coaches from the building.

### Pass draw (10 min)

This warm up is gets you ready to draw.

1. Open the whiteboard app for your team.
2. One person begin drawing a scene.
3. When you're done (5-10 seconds) stop. Someone else jump in.
4. Everyone on your team must draw at least three times.
5. When times up, tack a screenshot and post it to the group Team's channel.

### Target audience, user journey mapping (30 min)

This content is covered in the deck. The goal is to provide strategies to define who you're building for and describe there experience today. This will then feed into refining the problem statement.

### User journey mapping (30 min)

* With paper and a writing utensil, map the user journey.
* Consider what, why, and how? Use simple drawings and short phrases / words to describe what actions the user is tacking, what emotions are they expressing, and the users motivations.
* Keep it solution agnostic. Don't describe the details of how the user meets their needs.

### Regroup and share with team (15 min)

* Come back together with your team.
* Each person talk through their user journey, introducing the target audience, the person at the center of the journey, and talking through the stages including what, why, and how.
* Consider and discussed, what do you have in common? What was different that stretched your thinking?

### Write problem statement

With the problem statements the goal is to go from the vague high-level group problem statement, add definition, to create something that's meaningful, actionable, human-centric, based on the pain points and user needs you uncovered in the empathy mapping and user journey exercises.

1. Start by writing and thinking individually
    * Here you analyze, breaking down complex topics, and synthesize, piecing it back together, from what you've learned. It isn't easy.
    * Consider who is experience the problem, what is the problem, where is the problem faced and why does it matter that the problem is solved?

2. Come together and share using whiteboard
    * Open a whiteboard for your team.
    * Write your problem statements on a sticky note.
    * Share one by one and place them out in the board.
    * Place like problem statements together.
    * Circle the common groups and label with the theme. This is called an affinity diagram.
    * Save the white board.
    * Take a screenshot and post it to your team.

There are no right or wrong answers. This is a first take. We'll revisit and iterate.
