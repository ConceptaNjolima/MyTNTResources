# Team Project Practice
With this project NTs review a spec and break down the engineering work. The teams then merge initial changes for the project into the same repo and resolve and resolve any merge issues. The goal is not to complete the app as spec'd rather gain experience breaking down the work and coding together.

## Learning objectives
TNTs will understand how to break down work.
TNTs will understand how to scope work.
TNTs will practice merging and resolving merge conflicts.

## Time required and pace
Total time: 3 hours, 45 instruction, remaining work time
* 10 minutes - engage: revisit best practices for resolving merge conflicts
* 20 minutes - explain: introduce the spec, scoping, and breaking down work
* 1 hours - explore: during work time teams break down the engineering work and review with coaches, create and check-in first changes, resolve merge issues
* 1.5 hour - evaluate: NTs finish initial changes and resolve merge issues

## Background / review
* *Monday Spec intro presentation*

## Lesson details
### Revist best practices for resolving merge conflicts (20 min)

## Introduce spec, scoping, and breaking down work
1. For this project NTs will be provided with a spec. Spec, short for specification, is a description of the app and it's functionality. It defines what is being built, while capturing the essentials of why it's being built and how.

2. There are two steps to the project:
    * Finish the spec by scoping the minimal viable product, prioritizing the features, and breaking down the engineering work.
    * Build the initial screens for the project, merge them in the same repo, and connect the navigation across the screens.
    
3. Today we'll start by looking the spec. Use the discussion guide questions as you make decisions about the app scoping and work breakdown. Consult and get feedback from your coaches before you start building the screen.
