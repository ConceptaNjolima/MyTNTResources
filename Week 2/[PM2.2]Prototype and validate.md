# Prototype and validate

NTs explore some of their problem statement ideas through prototyping. It introduces the value of prototyping and various methods, starting with low fidelity options.

## Learning objectives

* TNTs will learn how to build a paper prototype.
* TNTs will be introduced to tools for additional prototyping.
* TNTs will understand how prototyping fits into the product life cycle.

## Time required and pace

Total time: 1.30 hour

* 10 minutes - engage: draw
* 30 minutes - explain: introduction to prototyping
* 50 minutes - explore: create paper prototype walkthrough
* 
* [After] - evaluate: practice and feedback with coaches

## Background / review

Deck:

## Lesson details

This lesson will be led by PM coaches from the building.

### Draw (10 min)

Warm up exercise to being drawing.

### Introduction to prototyping (20 min)

Details are in the deck. The phases of the design sprint are revisited. The role of UX designer is introduce. Prototyping and the value of prototyping is introduced. Three methods - drawing, low-fidelity mockup, high-fidelity interactive prototypes are discussed. Large screen vs. small screen considerations are discussed. The goal for the prototype and the User Feedback Jamboree is set.

### Create paper prototype walk through (50 min)

1. Pick one solution you want to explore further from Crazy 8s, or related to your leading problem statement.
2. Draw the high-level, low-fidelity screens or flow of the experience. Considering whether this should be a mobile or large screen experience.
3. Take about 25 minutes. You might have multiple options for a given task or user job.

Regroup as a team and share your walkthroughs.

### Combine walkthroughs (30)

1. Combine your walktrhoughs for the User Feedback Jamboree.
2. To prioritize, focus on which tasks you want to ge feedback on and how it ties back to your goals.
3. Add the tasks to your interview guide.
4. Prepare a combine version of the prototype.
